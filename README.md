   Method description <p>
   
Existing studies suggest the prominence of urban reclamation over agricultural reclamation. We, therefore, began our inquiry of understanding the worldwide scale and scope of the 21st century coastal land reclamation by examining cities. This paper analyzed all the coastal cities globally with over one million population as listed in the United Nations World Urbanization Prospect 2018 database. For 136 cities, we processed more than 50,000 Landsat images between 2000 and 2020 using the Aqua Monitor database and applied the Automatic Water Extraction Index (AWEI) along with OSTU adaptive thresholding technique61 in Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to quantify the global distribution of coastal reclamation. We then perform an in-depth literature search for possible information regarding coastal reclamation in the 20th century. Finally, land use over reclaimed land was mapped for the largest sites in each of the 17 regions by extracting data from OSM database (https://www.openstreetmap.org/). <p>
